This GitHub repository contains the code implementing the numerical investigations undertaken in the accompaning Masters thesis: Navigating Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Computing. 
The repo is split into two folders corresponding to Part 1 and Part 2 of the thesis. Any code for results presented in the appendix of the thesis will be in the folder for the associated part which the supplemantary result pertained to. 
Standard python libraries (Numpy, SciPy, Pandas) as well as Pennylane (Part 1) and Qiskit, and Qiskit Aer, (Part 2) are required to run the associated files. The code developed to run QAOA with pretrained parameters are presented in the file smartMQAOA.py. Examples of how it can be used to find an initial parameter set, or to run a trial on a given graph instance are given by the files PRETRAINER.py and TRIALER_Example respectively. It must be noted that sizable qubit sizes were simlutaed and simulation runtimes can be quite long.
In particular the reuslts for Part 2 were run using the Paswey Supercomputing Center's supercomputer Setonix. All data generated from these trials are presented in the Part 2 folder.
